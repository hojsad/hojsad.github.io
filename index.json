The reasons for the use Mamdani Fuzzy system are its capability of working in vague environment and using human knowledge and for mixed integer linear programming model is its capability in finding the optimum solution among the several available ones.

There are some difficulties in financial surveillance especially in the retrospective phase one of which being the posibility of existing outliers in the samples data. For this aim, in this paper some methods were proposed to estimate the parameters of the GARCH model based on maximum likelihood and robust estimation procedures. Then, the performance of Phase II residual Shewhart control chart with estimated parameters was evaluated according to in-control Average Run Length in the presence of outliers. The Monte Carlo simulation study was applied to evaluate the proposed methods considering different numerical examples. Finally, the US Dollar/Iran Rial (USD/IRR) exchange rate was considered for monitoring in which the results showed that the control chart was more sensitive when the robust methods were applied in the estimation procedure.","tags":null,"title":"The effect of parameter estimation on phase II control chart performance in monitoring financial GARCH processes with contaminated data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

A common practice to calculate Value at Risk (VaR) is based on the assumption that changes in the value of the portfolio are normally distributed. However, assets returns usually come from fat-tailed distributions. Therefore,computing VaR under the assumption of conditional normality can be an important source of error. Extreme value theory does not follow from the central limit theorem in mathematics,and instead is focused on extreme data. Therefore, this study examines the extreme value theory is a powerful framework for studying tail distributions. USD return and volatility is considered as a case study in this article. The normality assumption was rejected by examining the distribution of logarithmic returns. The results suggest that the application of EVT make better fit than the other models that are based on the assumption of normality.","tags":null,"title":"Using Extreme Value Theory to Estimate Value at Risk (Case Study: Foreign Exchange Rate)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

Then, the relationship between wavelet beta and mean stock return was evaluated on short-term, medium-term and long-term scales using least-squares technique. The findings indicate that the capital asset pricing model is a multi-scale model that uses different time scales for stock returns to provide different estimates of beta. Thus, Tehran Stock Exchange is a very efficient capital market on the long-term scale. Subsequently, values at risk of portfolios were calculated for each scale.
