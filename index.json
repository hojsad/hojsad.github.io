The Generelized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) time series model is widely applied for modelling financial processes. Therefore, traditional Shewhart control chart is developed to monitor GARCH processes. There are some difficulties in financial surveillance especially in the retrospective phase one of which being the posibility of existing outliers in the samples data. For this aim, in this paper some methods were proposed to estimate the parameters of the GARCH model based on maximum likelihood and robust estimation procedures. Then, the performance of Phase II residual Shewhart control chart with estimated parameters was evaluated according to in-control Average Run Length in the presence of outliers. The Monte Carlo simulation study was applied to evaluate the proposed methods considering different numerical examples. Finally, the US Dollar/Iran Rial (USD/IRR) exchange rate was considered for monitoring in which the results showed that the control chart was more sensitive when the robust methods were applied in the estimation procedure.","tags":null,"title":"The effect of parameter estimation on phase II control chart performance in monitoring financial GARCH processes with contaminated data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

A common practice to calculate Value at Risk (VaR) is based on the assumption that changes in the value of the portfolio are normally distributed. However, assets returns usually come from fat-tailed distributions. Therefore,computing VaR under the assumption of conditional normality can be an important source of error. Extreme value theory does not follow from the central limit theorem in mathematics,and instead is focused on extreme data. Therefore, this study examines the extreme value theory is a powerful framework for studying tail distributions. USD return and volatility is considered as a case study in this article. The normality assumption was rejected by examining the distribution of logarithmic returns. The results suggest that the application of EVT make better fit than the other models that are based on the assumption of normality.","tags":null,"title":"Using Extreme Value Theory to Estimate Value at Risk (Case Study: Foreign Exchange Rate)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hojjatollah Sadeqi"],"categories":null,"content":" Academic makes it easy to create a beautiful website for free using Markdown.

For Developing the theoretical model of Alignment strategies we used Grounded Theory Research Method. The statistical community in this study consisted of middle and senior managers of three branch pishgaman kavir group over the years 1389-90. Data collection of this study is extensive literature survey, strategic Alignment researches and various structured and semi-structured interviews. Data collected were analyzed in Atlas.ti software. The results of this study indicated that product represents the cornerstone for the strategy congruence in the company, being all strategies formulated around it and being the real linkage between marketing and manufacturing strategies. The output of marketing strategy and business strategy is related to the product and it works as an input for manufacturing in terms of product characteristics and production requirements.","tags":null,"title":"Developing a Theoretical Model for Alignment of Production Strategy, Marketing Strategy, and Business Strategy using Grounded Theory (Case study: Pishgamane Kavir Group)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

For this purpose, using market return, beta coefficient was calculated for daily return of 20 shares selected form Tehran Stock Exchange from March 2007 until March 2012. Then, the relationship between wavelet beta and mean stock return was evaluated on short-term, medium-term and long-term scales using least-squares technique. The findings indicate that the capital asset pricing model is a multi-scale model that uses different time scales for stock returns to provide different estimates of beta. Thus, Tehran Stock Exchange is a very efficient capital market on the long-term scale. Subsequently, values at risk of portfolios were calculated for each scale. According to the result, risk is highly concentrated on high-frequency time series (lower scales).","tags":null,"title":"Evaluating Value at Risk with Using Wavelet Analysis (Case Study: Tehran Stock Exchange)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

In the present study, common parametric and non-parametric methods of estimating the risk of financial assets are reviewed. Following that, a totally different parametric method named Cornish-Fisher (CF) estimate for estimation of VaR for financial fims listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange (Investment companies, Insurance companies, Leasing companies and banks) during 2010 to 2012 have been investigated. The findings of the current study indicate that this approximation has operated well for observations whose distribution has a small discrepancy with normal distribution. Using this approximate can lead to a more suitable risk management decisions.","tags":null,"title":"Value-at-Risk Measurement Using A Cornish-Fisher Approximation of Normal Distribution ( A Study of Iranian Financial Institutions)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
